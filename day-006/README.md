# 🚀 Day 6 of 100 Days of Code: Exploring Weather Data with Python! 🌦️📊

Today, I embarked on a journey into the fascinating realm of data exploration using Python. With a focus on weather data, I've created a simple yet powerful program that visualizes temperature trends over the past month in my local area.

## Highlights of Today's Adventure:
- **Data Collection:** Utilizing Python libraries to fetch weather data from an API, making it accessible for analysis.
- **Basic Visualization:** Employing Matplotlib, a beginner-friendly plotting library, to create clear and easy-to-understand line graphs showcasing temperature fluctuations.
- **Interpretation:** Gaining insights into weather patterns by observing trends and variations in temperature data.

Through this project, I'm not only honing my Python skills but also gaining a deeper understanding of weather patterns in my region.
