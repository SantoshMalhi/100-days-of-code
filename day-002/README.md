# Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode: Embracing the Word Counter Challenge! üìù

Keep those coding muscles toned with project number 2!

## Today's Project:
Today, I delved into the realm of text analysis with a simple yet powerful tool: a word counter crafted using Python. No more manual counting of words in lengthy documents‚Äîthis nifty script does the counting for me!

### Key Learnings:
- **File Handling:** Mastering the art of opening and reading text files in Python to analyze their content efficiently.
- **String Manipulation:** Harnessing the power of string operations to break down text into individual words for accurate counting.
- **Data Structures:** Exploring diverse data structures like lists and dictionaries to efficiently store and manage word counts, enhancing performance.
- **Output Formatting:** Presenting the word count in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format, making data interpretation a breeze.

### How to Use:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `word_counter.py` script and `sample_text.txt` file from this repository.
3. Run the `word_counter.py` script in your terminal or Python environment.
4. The script will read the text from `sample_text.txt`, count the number of words, and display the result.

### Future Improvements:
- Implement functionality to exclude common stop words from the word count.
- Add support for analyzing multiple text files simultaneously.

## Output:
